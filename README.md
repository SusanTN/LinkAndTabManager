## Key Features

     Labels are stored per session and reset when the browser restarts, keeping your workflow fresh.

2. **Move Tabs to Different Windows**
   - **Single Tab Movement**:  
     Right-click on any webpage or tab, select "Move to Window" from the context menu, and choose an existing window (displayed with your custom labels) or opt for a new window.
   - **Multiple Tabs Movement**:  
     Highlight multiple tabs in your current window, right-click on one of the selected tabs, and move them all at once to the target window.

3. **Open Links in Specific Windows**
   - Right-click on any link within a webpage, select "Open in Window" from the context menu, and choose the desired window from the list (with your labels) or open the link in a new window.

4. **Dynamic Window Listing**
   - Windows are listed with your assigned labels, or with their unique ID and the title of the first tab if no label is set. The context menu updates in real-time as windows are opened or closed.
